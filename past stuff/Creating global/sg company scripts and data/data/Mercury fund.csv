There are often decisions that are made without the entire organization knowing or understanding the reasoning behind decisions. Leaders also tends to have differing views on decisions that are made, so lower staff is left to determine how to navigate the differences and how to communicate effectively based on which leader they are talking to. Decisions often don't align with current ""investment themes"" and it is difficult to stay current on emerging trends/themes when they are not communicated to the organization as a whole. ""Investment themes"" are the closest thing we have to a vision statement, strategic pillars, etc. So when these seem to be in constant flux, it makes it difficult to do jobs well.","Whenever leadership partakes in culture events. Leaders (whether they know it or not) have a strong influence on the attitude and energy in the office. Their presence and participation is critical in establishing a culture and it often is not prioritized. When they show that their team is prioritized, it is felt."
