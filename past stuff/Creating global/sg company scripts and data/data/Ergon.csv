It seems as though 100% of our direction is dictated by our subsidiary strategies/mission statements but corporate direction is more ""piecemeal"".  Would like to see Ergon, Inc. change its CEO and provide employees with a plan for their futures that everyone can get behind and pull in the same direction.  We need to ID our core-competencies as in a way that opens everyone's eyes on a high level litmus test as to what kinds of business expansions in the future best suit what Ergon assets, Core Competencies and people do best.  We need to ""soul search"" and identify who we are, what we're best at and how we continue to grow.  Feels to me that our BOD may be more disconnected from providing direction to employees as to ""what do we want to look like when we're all grown up""?  Also would like to see incentive comp more closely tied to the successes and failures of each business unit and less Socialistic.  More $'s should be reserved for those that are great contributors along with providing employees with a roadmap (tied to performance reviews) on how to get where they want to get professionally."

We often boast about being an innovative company within our industry, but our actions on the business side don't reflect that. Our policies and mentality is very traditional and old fashioned. Simple gestures that innovative companies make are not even considered at Crafco. Not all jobs at Crafco are equal. We need to treat each department and each job with the nuance that it deserves. Some jobs have the ability to be given a little more freedom, be it working from home on occasion or adjusting our schedule from week to week. These are things that innovative companies are doing. Not only are we not doing those things, it's made clear that leadership is not even considering them. Innovative also support small gestures (causal Fridays, etc.) that go a long way with morale. We virtually never allow for these small things. If we want to move forward and see positive growth, we need to be willing to live up to our claim of being an innovative company. Let's maintain some of the important traditional values, but let's also evolve in other key areas. Thank you."

Also there have been many instances where our so called ""Leaders"" think that they have the right to do and say what ever they want to say to people they are ""over"".  A ""Leadership"" role is meant to lead not to tear down someone because they have made a mistake or because they have no idea what they are supposed to do.  A true Leader in my eyes is someone who is willing to stand up and say ""I have made this mistake before and this is what I have learned on how not to do things."".  Also someone who is willing to LISTEN to what their employees have to say and be able to help you.  Here our Leaders look down on you if you did not grow up in their generation, or if you think they are wrong and you stand up to them.  When I come into work I am excited to be HERE but the leadership makes you not want to be here because they never have anything positive to say about you, the work you do, or the things you are willing to try.  I would like for someone to investigate the leadership we have here and actually ask the employees what has happened and make sure they tell you everything that they have witnessed.    Thank you "

Many employees with young children, like myself, have had entire years where all of my vacation time has gone to Doctor appointments and sick days for my children. I know it is not the company's problem, but it certainly isn't beneficial to the company to have an employee who hasn't had any meaningful time off in multiple years. Employees in these situations are likely to become resentful because of a feeling that their life has become nothing but work. Unfair as that resent is, it can happen.   I would think that a simple 5 Day Sick Leave per year plan, that can be used to the employee's benefit on the first day of having been gone from work, would be plenty. Also, I would recommend that these days not roll over, and not pay out unless necessary. Additionally, enforce a strict rule that if more than one day is used in succession, the employee must provide a Doctor's note to return to work. This would help prevent abuse of this generous leave program."

As for operations, with the new OMS system coming into play, it takes away our ability to entice new customers to either buy certain products or more of what they actually need. When the new system comes into action, it'll require any pricing to be done by quote and I can understand why you would want this done for control purposes. But when doing this, there are quite a few clients that come in and want info and product fast and once we mention getting them a quote they tell us, ""No, that's alright, I'll figure something else out.""  But if we train every level of operations for what margins need to stay above then for anything small quantity or single buy items (floor equipment, small jobs), we should be able to do an instore quote to entice the potential customer and get there business to remain here rather than tell them retail is all we can do without a quote. When doing this it provides more opportunity to sell more equipment, tools, material in conjunction with each other and get more profit over all then maybe getting one or two things sold and having things sit in inventory. This also allows the potential small job clients to upscale their business and when doing so they will continue to come back to us for all their needs. If trained properly, we could ensure quantity and profits rise."

Whether they are sponsoring a race, an amphitheater, a baseball team, or they are providing items for local schools, they do so much around the Jackson area. And its a great thing, because Jackson needs help. I would love to see Ergon team up (or spearhead a project) with other businesses and schools to become an even greater resource for the local community.  Mississippi gets a bad rap for a lot of reasons.  I think businesses such as Ergon can help provide more for the community which would bring people to our area and keep those graduates from Millsaps, Belhaven, JSU, Hinds. etc. from leaving our state to find a city with more to offer. Making Jackson a greater place to live, with more to do will eventually add up to a greater pool of skilled workers which will be a positive impact for Ergon. "

What I mean by this is Ergon needs to be Ergon, not 20 different companies.

Additionally, we have too many systems that do not talk to each other. PCARD, SAP, Direct Pay...

Implementing clear standard operating procedures and improving new hire and continuing education training would help substantially.  Setting measurable goals and realistic timelines on projects would help keep employees on track.  Having different departments engage with each other more to help understand other areas of the business would also be beneficial.  Sales, engineering, customer service/marketing, and accounting should come together more regularly to better understand our products, our market, and our true costs.  We spend too much time investing in product lines that do not earn money, and not enough time in areas that have real growth potential and good profit margins.  Streamlining could help immensely with workload and profitability.  "
