For starters, when you are asking about leadership, there needs to be a distinction between corporate leadership and local leadership. Do I trust my local leadership team, absolutely, do I trust the corporate leadership team, not as much. Generalized questions about leadership teams when you work for a tiered organization lead to ambiguous answers.  Also, It seems corporate leaders are a little out of touch with what drives employee participation. Most people at lower levels do not live and breath mission statements. We base our decisions to continue working for a company on factors like, am I fairly compensated for my time, does my direct manager support me when I have a problem, am I able to take sick days when necessary, and do I have a clear understanding of what my job entails.  People don't need happy mantras and fancy attribute acronyms to be good employees. They need good bosses, competent co-workers, and reasonable compensation."

Badgering of hard workers who bring issues to light, and no accountability for those lacking.  I feel we have an amazing mission and great core values, but they fall flat at my location. It isn't enough. We are constantly pushed to the extreme and taken advantage of- moral is at an all time low and you are slowly losing DECADES of experience and DEDICATED employees. It is a shame the flagship location has been run into the ground and is now being turned into a mini SCI.  I would hope others are just as honest as me on this survey. I have to believe not every location is this way, otherwise the core values and missions I believe about Northstar aren't true.

The end result ultimately  leads to unnecessary turnover when once happy employee's become disgruntled over pay... Having to hire people who are desperate for *any* pay regardless of the job rarely fosters the best applicants, and as such, the company gets what they pay for.

There is not a smooth transition always.  I have not been with the organization for a long time, but I often find that when someone is out, messages go without being taken care of and family's feel anxious that they don't know the answers.  ","One of my best moments was when a manager told me that one of the people that I transferred to her complemented me. She expressed that I was much more helpful than the answering service and other people that she had interacted with on the phone.  She appreciated that I made sure to understand what her needs were and to direct her to the correct person.  For me it is always a good day when I can help someone get the answer that they have been waiting for.

In my experience, management will not stand behind decisions that best serve families grieving the loss of a loved one, even when they are made with both ethics and the company in mind. This results in employees feeling they must get permission from management for any situation that is slightly out of the ordinary. This undermines employees ability to confidently serve families and means management is overwhelmed with small matters that employees could handle, given a certain amount of autonomy to do so. It also results in families frustrated that the matter cannot be resolved in a timely matter, as management is often unavailable, in meetings, etc. It would serve families and their perception of the company better if employees were empowered to make things right/do the right thing for the family with confidence and compassion.","I love serving families in my capacity as funeral director.  Any day were departments work together for the best possible experience for a family, or a service is really and truly personalized and I have a change to go above and beyond for a family is a ""Best Day"". I get to be myself and use what makes me unique as a person to craft the most memorable and special experience for a family.

If another department makes a mistake or drops the ball, we are to blame. This creates a lack of trust and resentment between departments. Departments should be held accountable for their own responsibilities. This would foster trust between departments and a sense of teamwork throughout the company. It would also make each department's workload more manageable if they were able to focus on their responsibilities and trust that other departments would follow through as well. If funeral directors are held accountable for the work of every department and must babysit them in order to avoid reprimand, funeral directors should facilitate all aspects of funeral service instead of relying on other departments, and more funeral directors should be hired to handle increased workload.  Within my team of funeral directors, I feel supported, mentored, and that we hold ourselves and each other accountable. I answered for my Northstar location team as a whole. I do not feel supported or mentored by management, admin, or our family service advisors/sales team. It does not seem that these groups are held accountable or always seek to do what is best for the families we serve.   I wish all departments were better attuned to the realities families face after the loss of a loved one. I feel that our mission statement/purpose and the core values we talk about are not realized in the way we do business or approach mistakes or our client families. "

During the day we serve families and help them through the worst days of their lives or help them pre-arrange for their final plans.

I cherish their friendship and their support and their constructive criticism.  They are the hardest working people and extremely sincere in everything they do.  Mangers, supervisiors and etc. need to hear the voices of the people that work for them to better understand the needs of the families we service.  Our prices are not meeting families needs.  We have priced ourselves outside the market value and we are losing too much business . We are in an area where families can go 5 to 10 miles in any direction and purchase what they need for alot less.  I am a positive person and adapt well to change. I respect everyone around me.    "

This week on three different days I called into the location as I was working from home.  Each day I got the answering service between 9:30 and 11:00.  Day one it happened 4 times.  Day two 3 times, Day 3 1 time.  Clearly we have many lost opportunities for revenue because of this.  There is a whole team of people who are acutely qualified to answer calls and book and close appointments who have no access to them.  It has effected income and attitude and has one group have to hunt like crazy to find something to sell,m while the other thrives off of incoming calls and walks and the referrals from them.  Really sad and ultimately bad for the organization.","Sadly, I have not had one in a very long time.

However I have watched persons with little to no integrity year after year be allowed to remain with the organization despite being identified and the issues known.  Some of them have been downgraded to lower positions.  But with human nature being what it is, it is clear that did not fix their lack of integrity.  I have been told it is because they can sell.  What does that say about how our organization  feels about the sales process?  I have always excelled in the field and have never had to cheat others to do it.  I would like to think the the company puts integrity first...but that does not appear to be the case.Further, sometimes I think that the management strategies are quite abusive and archaic.  Witholding earnings not because a blue form is not turned in, but because it is not uploaded into CRM is an example.  When you have never been shown how to do it and you therefore go to the Admin., and the Memorial departments and they don't know how to do it either...there appears to be a problem with the training arm of the process.  One of my leaders is exceptional at these things, including integrity and the other not so much.  It is a shame though that it is the producer of the revenue that gets hurt in these types of situations.  I think it is reasonable to conclude when these types of things happen it can hurt motivation to continue to produce."

However, the same people go to management, and when managment does the right thing by saying me that person who is having the issue. And my managers need to sit down face to face, the person avoids the meeting. We have rescheduled this meeting. I don't think we need babysitters and it's silly that co workers cannot solve an issue by speaking to the person about it. We are adults. I see some people pointing fingers at everything but themselves. I don't understand how someone can have that lack of self understanding to see that this is not a solution, no one would be upset with anyone if we spoke honestly and openly about any issues. We are adults, yet, act as children. I don't see accountability in certain people. I have no issue admitting my mistakes. It clarifies and helps everyone fully grasp the situation. I understand we don't wish to lose people but, there must be consequences, EQUALLY, and I'm not unincluding myself. ","When I felt like we all got together and buckled down on a large call volume and case load. Day shift stayed and in turn we were able to get people ready for the next day. This shouldn't be a one time or not constant thing. If you are a team, you don't always have the capacity to leave right on time. And an extra few minutes won't put overtime into a crazy amount. I don't leave my team regress if they like me or not just because  it's time to go.

It is so obvious that money is the driving narrative from management-the corporate rhetoric is indifferent to the families who work here, have family resting here, and serving the families that purchase here.  The death care industry should NOT be run with a corporate state of mind especially in today's social media laden world and the specific historical significance Restland has in Dallas and Texas.  There are generations of family here that no longer have faith in us and they have valid complaints about the neglect of our cemetery and integrity within our funeral home operations.  We keep being told NSMG doesn't have the money to fund Restland properly to restore it etc. and that answer is unacceptable. The perceived company indifference only layers on resentment from employees and clients.  Restland needs more help than perhaps NSMG can give it?  We need millions to fix the years of neglect, just look at our sidewalks and how terrible the cemetery looks.  If first impressions are all that matter, ours is an embarrassment to the many wonderful folks that work here and truly want to help.  The public may be punitive at times with how they experience our breakdowns as human beings serving others, BUT they are also very aware that the ""company"" doesn't care anymore.  We simply do not have enough man power or company investment to restore all the damage from previous ownership and neglect.  Regardless of the P and L statements, this industry has to put people first.  There are so many good folks at Restland who give their all but without the company being willing to put more money into Restland we ultimately suffer the hardship of disappointing folks during the worst time of their life.  This leaves a lasting traumatic impression during what should be an opportunity to help folks grieve well.  How can we do God's work when our hands our tied?  I understand profit matters to sustainability but all you need to do is spend one day here to see the lost faith in our employees and families. Most of us work here and have family resting here.  This place may not be able to be restored to it's old days of glory but that is certainly no reason to give up on Restland.  I feel there needs to be more money spent here than anyone is willing to do because of the rhetoric of profit over people.  It is so obvious our VP of sales could care less about anything other than money and expresses an attitude of self importance rather than helping the team including our sales manager.  Sales mean nothing if the company cannot follow through.  Sparkman Hillcrest may be just as challenging behind the scenes but at least they keep their grounds presentable and ""hide"" their problems from the public.  Restland is so out of control in the public's perception that ""I am sorry"" is not enough.  Something big really needs to shift in the focus and narrative of how NSMG perceives success even if it costs them  PROFIT or BONUS.  How do they expect us to sell a $60000 estate when the grounds look awful, you may not get the funeral director you met and worked with on the day of your funeral, and all we can tell folks is ""we are sorry and are working on it"".  It is my understanding that the Abbey Maus Roof should have been replaced years ago-how did this happen?  It is beautiful and has amazing property still available but it is in a state of decay that is humiliating to Restland.  I don't know what the answer is but I do know it will take making decisions that aren't normal to a corporate mentality of profit only.  I am not saying that NSMG is bad nor are the folks who are at the top-but this lack of connection to the real issue-serving our families-has to stop.  We are losing more families each day to our competitors and they will sadly and gladly tell you a consistent story of why they left our care.  They will generally say: we nickel and dime, our prices no longer reflect our quality of service, our cemetery looks terrible, and they cannot trust us-period.  In an ever changing world with more and more disinformation spread without consequence folks are smarting up and going to spend where they will be treated like people not profit.  My family is buried here and I LOVE my job however I have to pray for Restland and everything I sell.  I pray we can restore and rebuild before we become yet another casualty of corporate greed.  ","When I can present options to family with confidence and sell what I know will come through.  I LOVE helping folks plan ahead because I want to restore families.  Helping avoid trauma so folks can grieve well.

We care and want the support to show that in action.  There are wonderful employees here and a few  bad apples as there are with any organization.  Senior management can sometimes be complacent with acknowledging the breakdown in our culture or avoid dealing with the subject all together.  Again, the focus is always on numbers versus how to create those numbers through action requiring investment in our property and people.  Let's make Restland great again, for lack of a better term.

Extreme ownership does not apply to all.  Management could not be less interested in their jobs, thinking since they have made it to the 'big chair' they no longer have to put in the work. Management believes only the word of sales and no-one else. I know this because no-one is ever asked their side.  I suppose it is due to the fact the allegedly sales bring the money. Ironically, due in large part to sales, we lose a ton of money with law suits, rush ordering, overnight shipping, refunds,  funerals, plots and merchandise we have to give away. Location is reactive, not proactive. I could go on, need I? Additionally, are these surveys even read, much less taken seriously if submitted by field admin? "
